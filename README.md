## Building

Build by making a build directory (i.e. `build/`), run `cmake` in that dir, and then use `make` to build the desired target.

Example:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Debug | Coverage | Release]
make
./main
make test      # Makes and runs the tests.
make coverage  # Generate a coverage report.
make doc       # Generate html documentation.
```
